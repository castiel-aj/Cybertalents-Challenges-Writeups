\- After downloading the **0.7z** archive and opening it using the provided password: **CyberTalents**

I found another archive (1.7z), and a photo (1.png) which we should use it to find the password of the 1.7z archive

the photo is about a garden, and a dummy that looks like it was made in japan.

I used **ImgOps** online tool which provides (reverse / similar) search of images, to find more info about it.

I selected Google to search for relevant indexed photos on the web:

Then, I narrowed the selection from the photo to only fit the dummy (because I found it most strange object in the photo), and the results immediately mentioned the name of the location where many dummies like this exists .

It is the **Nagoro Village**

link for google maps of the Nagoro Village: 

https://www.google.com/maps/@33.8564698,134.0195175,3a,75y,32.41h,80.19t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqjx-m0ZI3qtpSEHBomWQ3w!2e0!5s20141001T000000!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu

I copied the URL of the Wikipedia page **(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoro)**, and generated **MD5 hash** for it using ********MD5 Generator****** website, to have the password:   d34af31c6f95e8db2b3aa451a8f9d63a

and used it to open the **1.7z** archive. Which contained another photo **2.png**, and another archive **2.7z**

The photo was about a nature view with a small castle:

![2](https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/08/jD9a8SIchN5eWGO.png)

This time, I used google lense, selected the castle from the image, and the first result was about **(castlello caldora).**

![image-20231207220341582](https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/08/fX5neJ9lrECKI4k.png)

I googled it to find its English Wikipedia page, and the md5 hash of that page was the password

The password for **2.7z** is: **879a7a1efb80cf7b5a00b5eb5ca290b7**

\- The **2.7z** archive also contained another archive **3.7z,** and a photo **3.png**

The photo 3.png looked like it was taken from a wooden Japanese house in a Japanese village...

![3](https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/08/jztR8DdhcZsP6Tn.png)

I  simply searched in google for: Traditional Japanese villages

and among the the first three result was (**Shirakawa**) village, the md5 hash of its Wikipedia page was the password

![image-20231208111124189](https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/08/YURKOxbZDIBG6vL.png)

the md5 hash of its Wikipedia page was correct when I used it to open the 3.7z file

the Wikipedia page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirakawa,_Gifu_(village)

The md5 hash of the Wikipedia page of the village in (3.png), and the password for the 3.7z file is:

fa94afd96d3836abbdae2bbde08ba3c0



The 3.7z file had one file which contained the flag:  **flag{e827a89870a9089870ca28d28e50ceb7}**
