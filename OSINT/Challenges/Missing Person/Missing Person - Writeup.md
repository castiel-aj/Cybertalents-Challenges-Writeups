\- We're requested to find the last time that **"Winwodem Strulovitch"** was actively online

The attached PDF document has basic info about that person, with a note found in his notebook in his room:

As it is tempting to find what that link has (https://bit.ly/3frKIAX), I started by checking it. It showed as a deleted tweet:

![image-20231208164610016](https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/08/6b8mQBVxuIg9dzK.png)



\- Since the tweet came from the **bitly** website, we can use **bitly** website to know the original link of that tweet.

To do so, we simply add a ( **+** ) at the end of the URL, to be:

https://bit.ly/3frKIAX+

and there, we find the original Twitter link for that post, which is: https://twitter.com/rzsdw2iwug77eda/status/1394223468003176455

\- Since we now have the link for the original tweet, we look for the time that it was posted (because it the request of our challenge). 

to find the time of that twitter post, we use the **TweetedAT** website: 

https://oduwsdl.github.io/tweetedat/

and enter the ID of that tweet (which is the last section of its URL): **1394223468003176455**

And based on it, we have our flag!

the flag is: **flag{17-05-2021_09:29}**
