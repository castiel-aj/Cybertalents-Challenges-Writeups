# CyberTalents Blue Team Scholarship Writeups

Hey there! During my three-month learning journey, I'll be diving into the exciting world of cybersecurity with CyberTalents. I'll be taking two advanced courses on their platform, where I'll gain hands-on experience and learn from some of the best instructors in the field.

The first course is called "CyberTalents Certified SOC Analyst," where I'll be honing my skills in handling security incidents and managing a Security Operations Center (SOC). It's all about detecting and responding to cyber threats effectively.

The second course, "CyberTalents Certified Threat Hunter," sounds even more thrilling! I'll be learning the art of proactive hunting for cyber threats, seeking out those sneaky adversaries before they can cause any harm.

I can't wait to explore these courses, take on challenges, and share my progress with you all. Join me on this cybersecurity adventure, and together, we'll become skilled defenders of the digital world! Let's go! ðŸš€ðŸ’»ðŸ”’
